# Neural-Decoder-Challenge

This project investigated different machine learning techniques to classify and regress neural data.
The task was to build an optimal neural decoder, in terms of speed and accuracy, that could estimate hand position.
Data was collected from 98 neurons and a position marker using a monkey as a test subject. 
The classification and regression models were firstly trained and then tested in the estimator files.
